# CorpusFlower Branding & Visual Identity

CorpusFlower is positioned as a **dark-academia botanical concordance engine**:
a tool that lets meaning bloom organically from a body of text (the corpus).

## Brand Pillars

1. **Illumination**  
   CorpusFlower shines light on buried patterns, references, and themes within text corpora.

2. **Blooming Insight**  
    Knowledge is treated as something that grows from roots and stems into petals and flowers.

3. **Scholarly Ritual**  
   The tool is inspired by monastic scriptoria, devotional reading, and disciplined study.

4. **Botanical Metaphor**  
   Roots, stems, petals, and blooms are used to describe different layers of the system.

5. **Dark Academia**  
   The intended vibe is candlelit study, vellum, ink, and pressed flowers rather than neon dashboards.

## Visual Style

- **Overall Aesthetic:**  
  Dark-academia botanical, with hints of illuminated manuscripts and herbarium pages.
- **Imagery:**  
  - Stylized flowers with subtle glyphs or text fragments in the petals.
  - Books whose edges trail into roots or vines.
  - Lanterns, candles, and subtle textual motifs.
- **Avoid:**  
  - Gore or horror aesthetics (no explicit corpse imagery).
  - Bright, cartoonish floral icons.
  - Generic clip-art styles.

## Recommended Color Palette

- **Deep Ink Black** — `#0A0A0A`  
- **Vellum Ivory** — `#F8F4E3`  
- **Dried Rose** — `#A45A6C`  
- **Botanical Green** — `#567C56`  
- **Parchment Gold** — `#D7B77E`  
- **Shadow Violet** — `#463B5E`  

These can be combined to evoke aged paper, ink, dried petals, and nocturnal study spaces.
